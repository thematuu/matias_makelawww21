    CSS is designed to <strong>enable</strong> the separation of presentation
     and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<p>
      This separation can improve content accessibility,
       provide more <em>flexibility</em> and control in the 
       specification of presentation characteristics, 
       enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
       by specifying the relevant <span>CSS</span> in a separate
     .css file, and reduce complexity and 
     repetition in the structural content.</p>
<article><h1>My first article</h1>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup 
    page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
     in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
     and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
      the content is accessed on a mobile device</p>
